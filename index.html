				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class="container mt-4">
					<p>
						I'm an engineer, product developer, and leader,
						currently based in Montreal, QC &#x1F341;, on a mission
						to make the world a better place by building teams to
						develop revolutionary products that solve real-world
						problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Organizations are increasingly being asked to "do more
						with less," meaning teams need to become more agile. I
						believe developing a strong and authentic vision
						instills a sense of purpose in teams and provides a
						framework to build revolutionary products to solve
						real-world problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of the office, I enjoy playing sports like
						hockey &#x1F3D2; and golf &#x26F3;, along with other
						activities that get me out of the house such as running
						&#x1F3C3;, biking &#x1F6B4;, and the occasional pint
						with friends &#x1F37B;.

						<h3>Build Teams</h3>
						<p>
							8+ years of experience building and leading
							cross-functional engineering teams combined with 9
							seasons as a collegiate head hockey coach has shaped
							to be the leader I am today. Obtaining
							certifications as a Scrum Master (CSM), Certified
							Product Owner (CSPO), and Scrum@Scale Practitioner
							further enables me to continuously develop and
							improve team dynamics.

						<h3>Develop Products</h3>
						<p>
							6+ years of developing business plans, product
							roadmaps, and go-to-market strategies based on
							market research and customer-specific requirements
							have led to industry-leading avionics products. More
							recently, I have led multiple hardware and software
							product lines with yearly revenues of $15m+.
