				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					I'm an Engineer / Product Developer / Leader currently based
					in Montreal, QC &#x1F341; on a mission to make the world a
					better place by solving unique problems and simplifying /
					improving existing solutions.
				</p>
				<p style="font-weight: 600; color: red;">
					Regardless...I'm missing something here. The above section
					should state my why (as a person) and this section should
					parlay my professional aspirations into that.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time I enjoy playing sports like hockey &#x1F3D2;
					and golf &#x26F3; along with other activities that get me
					out of the house such as running &#x1F3C3;, biking
					&#x1F6B4;, and the occasional pint with friends &#x1F37B;.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-top: 4rem;">
					An engineer, slash product developer, slash leader,
					currently based in Montreal, QC exploring ways to make the
					world a better place by solving real painful problems by
					simplifying them.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m a thinker and experimentalist. I find things with
					unnecessary complexity, test, fail, and fail 1000x more
					until I find a simple solution. When I’m not doing my job, I
					spend my time thinking or blabbering about how to solve said
					complexity.
