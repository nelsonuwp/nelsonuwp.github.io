				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					An engineer, product developer, and leader, currently based
					in Montreal, QC &#x1F341; on a mission to make the world a
					better place by building teams to develop revolutionary
					products that solve real-world problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Organizations are increasingly being asked to "do more with
					less" meaning teams need to become more agile. I believe
					developing a strong and authentic vision instils a sense of
					purpose in teams and provides a framework to build
					revolutionary products to solve real-world problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of the office I enjoy playing sports like hockey
					&#x1F3D2; and golf &#x26F3; along with other activities that
					get me out of the house such as running &#x1F3C3;, biking
					&#x1F6B4;, and the occasional pint with friends &#x1F37B;.

					<h3>Build Teams</h3>
					<p>
						8+ years of experience building and leading
						cross-functional engineering teams combined with 9
						seasons as a collegiate head hockey coach, has shaped to
						be the leader I am today. Obtaining certifications as a
						Scrum Master (CSM), Certified Product Owner (CSPO), and
						Scrum@Scale Practitioner further enables me to
						continuously develop and improve team dynamics.

					<h3>Develop Products</h3>
					<blockquote cite="Jeff Bezos">
						We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on detailsâ€¦.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						6+ years of developing business plans, product roadmaps,
						and go-to-market strategies based on market research and
						customer-specific requirements have led to
						industry-leading avionics products. More recently, I
						have led multiple hardware and software product lines
						with yearly revenues of $15m+.
