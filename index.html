				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<div class="container mt-4">
					<p>
						I'm an engineer, product developer, and leader,
						currently based in Montreal, QC &#x1F341;, on a mission
						to make the world a better place by building teams to
						develop revolutionary products that solve real-world
						problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						Organizations are increasingly being asked to "do more
						with less" to stay competitive in today's market.
						Building agile teams that can quickly respond to
						changing market needs is crucial to developing products
						that delight customers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of the office, I enjoy playing sports like
						hockey &#x1F3D2; and golf &#x26F3;, along with other
						activities that get me out of the house, such as running
						&#x1F3C3;, biking &#x1F6B4;, and the occasional pint
						with friends &#x1F37B;.

						<h3>Build Teams</h3>
						<p>
							8+ years of experience building and leading
							cross-functional engineering teams combined with 9
							seasons as a collegiate head hockey coach has shaped
							to be the leader I am today. Obtaining
							certifications as a Scrum Master (CSM), Certified
							Product Owner (CSPO), and Scrum@Scale Practitioner
							further enables me to continuously develop and
							improve team dynamics.

						<h3>Develop Products</h3>
						<p>
							8+ years of building and growing brands in the
							avionics industry, resulting in annual revenues of
							15m+. By developing business plans, product
							roadmaps, marketing material, and go-to-market
							strategies, our products have increased aircraft
							safety, reduced operating costs, and improved
							product robustness.
						</p>
						<blockquote cite="Stephen King">
							A product is something made in a factory; a brand is
							something that is bought by the customer. A product
							can be copied by a competitor; a brand is unique. A
							product can be quickly outdated; a successful brand
							is timeless.

						<h3>Solve Problems</h3>
